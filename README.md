## About

This project is part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree under the name - Project P5: Make Your App Material.

### Project Overview:
In this project, I redesigned an app to follow the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html) and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

### Why this Project?
This project gave me the opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users would love. It also would replicate a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What did I learn?

Through this project, I did:

* Understood the fundamentals of Android design.
* Applied Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separated an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively used transitions and motion.

## Rubric Check list

- [x] App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (```FloatingActionButton```, ```AppBarLayout```, ```SnackBar```, etc).
- [x] App uses ```CoordinatorLayout``` for the main Activity.
- [x] App theme extends from ```AppCompat```.
- [x] App uses an ```AppBar``` and associated ```Toolbars```.
- [x] App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
- [x] App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the [Material Design specification](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html).
- [x] App has a consistent color theme defined in ```styles.xml```. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
- [x] App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
- [x] App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
- [x] App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
- [x] App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.
